# Digital Payment Assistant - Team F1

This repository contains the implementation for the Digital Payment Assistant of Team F1 for the Agility Testbed of the ING Honours 2018. The goal of the Agility Testbed is to get a better understanding of software agility and to develop a testbed of comparable systems. In this project a group of students of the University of Twente is asked to create a digital payment assistant, assisting consumers in managing and analysing their bank accounts, after which the students have to deal with a high number of changing requirements.
